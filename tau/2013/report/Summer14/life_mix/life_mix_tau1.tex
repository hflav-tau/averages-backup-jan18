\mysubsection{\b-hadron lifetimes}
%------------------------------------------------
\labs{lifetimes}

In the spectator model the decay of \b-flavoured hadrons $H_b$ is
governed entirely by the flavour changing \particle{b\to Wq} transition
($\particle{q}=\particle{c,u}$).  For this very reason, lifetimes of all
\b-flavoured hadrons are the same in the spectator approximation
regardless of the (spectator) quark content of the $H_b$.  In the early
1990's experiments became sophisticated enough to start seeing the
differences of the lifetimes among various $H_b$ species.  The first
theoretical calculations of the spectator quark effects on $H_b$
lifetime emerged only few years earlier.

Currently, most such calculations are performed in the framework of
the Heavy Quark Expansion, HQE.  In the HQE, under certain assumptions
(the most important of which is that of
quark-hadron duality~\cite{Shifman:2000jv}), the decay
rate of an $H_b$ to an inclusive final state $f$ is expressed as the sum
of a series of expectation values of operators of increasing dimension,
multiplied by the correspondingly higher powers of $\Lambda_{\rm
QCD}/m_b$:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{H_b\to f} = |{\rm CKM}|^2\sum_n c_n^{(f)}
\Bigl(\frac{\Lambda_{\rm QCD}}{m_b}\Bigr)^n\langle H_b|O_n|H_b\rangle,
\labe{hqe}
\end{equation}
where $|{\rm CKM}|^2$ is the relevant combination of the CKM matrix elements.
The coefficients $c_n^{(f)}$ of this expansion, known as the Operator Product
Expansion~\cite{Shifman:1986mx,*Chay:1990da,*Bigi:1992su,*Bigi:1992su_erratum},
can be calculated perturbatively.  Hence, the HQE
predicts $\Gamma_{H_b\to f}$ in the form of an expansion in both
$\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/m_{\b}$ and $\alpha_s(m_{\b})$.  The precision of
current experiments makes it mandatory to go to the next-to-leading
order in QCD, {\em i.e.}\ to include corrections of the order of
$\alpha_s(m_{\b})$ to the $c_n^{(f)}$ terms.  All non-perturbative physics
is shifted into the expectation values $\langle H_b|O_n|H_b\rangle$ of
operators $O_n$.  These can be calculated using lattice QCD or QCD sum
rules, or can be related to other observables via the
HQE~\cite{Bigi:1995jr,*Bellini:1996ra}.  One may reasonably expect that powers of
$\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/m_{\b}$ provide enough suppression that only the
first few terms of the sum in \Eq{hqe} matter.

Theoretical predictions are usually made for the ratios of the lifetimes
(with $\tau(\Bd)$ chosen as the common denominator) rather than for the
individual lifetimes, for this allows several uncertainties to cancel.
The precision of the current HQE calculations (see
\Refs{Ciuchini:2001vx,*Beneke:2002rj,*Franco:2002fc,Tarantino:2003qw,*Gabbiani:2003pq,Gabbiani:2004tp} for the latest updates)
is in some instances already surpassed by the measurements,
\eg\ in the case of $\tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)$.  Also, HQE calculations are
not assumption-free.  More accurate predictions are a matter of progress
in the evaluation of the non-perturbative hadronic matrix elements and
verifying the assumptions that the calculations are based upon.
However, the HQE, even in its present shape, draws a number of important
conclusions, which are in agreement with experimental observations:
\begin{itemize}
\item The heavier the mass of the heavy quark, the smaller is the
  variation in the lifetimes among different hadrons containing this
  quark, which is to say that as $m_{\b}\to\infty$ we retrieve the
  spectator picture in which the lifetimes of all $H_b$ states are the same.
%OS  This is well illustrated by the fact that lifetimes in the $b$ sector
%OS  are all rather similar, while in the $c$ sector
%OS  ($m_{\particle{c}}<m_{\b}$) lifetimes differ by large factors.
   This is well illustrated by the fact that lifetimes are rather
   similar in the \b sector, while they differ by large factors
   in the \particle{c} sector ($m_{\particle{c}}<m_{\b}$).
\item The non-perturbative corrections arise only at the order of
  $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}^2/m_{\b}^2$, which translates into 
  differences among $H_b$ lifetimes of only a few percent.
\item It is only the difference between meson and baryon lifetimes that
  appears at the $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}^2/m_{\b}^2$ level.  The splitting of the
  meson lifetimes occurs at the $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}^3/m_{\b}^3$ level, yet it is
  enhanced by a phase space factor $16\pi^2$ with respect to the leading
  free \b decay.
\end{itemize}

To ensure that certain sources of systematic uncertainty cancel, 
lifetime analyses are sometimes designed to measure
ratios of lifetimes.  However, because of the differences in decay
topologies, abundance (or lack thereof) of decays of a certain kind,
{\em etc.}, measurements of the individual lifetimes are also 
common.  In the following section we review the most common
types of lifetime measurements.  This discussion is followed by the
presentation of the averaging of the various lifetime measurements, each
with a brief description of its particularities.

\mysubsubsection{Lifetime measurements, uncertainties and correlations}

In most cases, the lifetime of an $H_b$ state is estimated from a flight
distance measurement
and a $\beta\gamma$ factor which is used to convert the geometrical
distance into the proper decay time.  Methods of accessing lifetime
information can roughly be divided in the following five categories:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf\em Inclusive (flavour-blind) measurements}.  These
  measurements are aimed at extracting the lifetime from a mixture of
  \b-hadron decays, without distinguishing the decaying species.  Often
  the knowledge of the mixture composition is limited, which makes these
  measurements experiment-specific.  Also, these
  measurements have to rely on Monte Carlo simulation for estimating the
  $\beta\gamma$ factor, because the decaying hadrons are not fully
  reconstructed.  On the bright side, these are usually the largest
  statistics \b-hadron lifetime measurements that are accessible to a
  given experiment, and can, therefore, serve as an important
  performance benchmark.
\item {\bf\em Measurements in semileptonic decays of a specific
  {\boldmath $H_b$\unboldmath}}.  The \particle{W} boson from \particle{\b\to Wc}
  produces a $\ell\nu_l$ pair (\particle{\ell=e,\mu}) in about 21\% of the
  cases.  The electron or muon from such decays provides a clean and efficient
  trigger signature.
  The \particle{c} quark from the \particle{b\to Wc} transition and the other
  quark(s) making up the decaying $H_b$ combine into a charm hadron,
  which is reconstructed in one or more exclusive decay channels.
  Knowing what this charmed hadron is allows one to separate, at least
  statistically, different $H_b$ species.  The advantage of these
  measurements is in statistics, which is usually superior to the case of
  exclusively reconstructed $H_b$ decays.  Some of the main
  disadvantages are related to the difficulty of estimating the lepton+charm
  sample composition and to the Monte Carlo reliance for
  the momentum (and hence $\beta\gamma$ factor) estimate.
\item {\bf\em Measurements in exclusively reconstructed hadronic decays}.
  These
  have the advantage of complete reconstruction of the decaying $H_b$ state, 
  which allows one to infer the decaying species as well as to perform precise
  measurement of the $\beta\gamma$ factor.  Both lead to generally
  smaller systematic uncertainties than in the above two categories.
  The downsides are smaller branching ratios and larger combinatorial
  backgrounds, especially in $H_b\rightarrow H_c\pi(\pi\pi)$ and
  multi-body $H_c$ decays, or in a hadron collider environment with
  non-trivial underlying event.  Decays of the type $H_b\to \jpsi H_s$ are
  relatively clean and easy to trigger, due to the $\jpsi\to \ell^+\ell^-$
  signature, but their branching fraction is only about 1\%.
\item {\bf\em Measurements at asymmetric B factories}. 
  In the $\Ups\rightarrow B \bar{B}$ decay, the \B mesons (\Bu or \Bd) are
essentially at rest in the \Ups frame.  This makes direct lifetime
measurements impossible in experiments at symmetric colliders producing 
\Ups at rest. 
%Romulus% However, most time-integrated measurements that related to
%Romulus% directly measure the overall mixing probability, \chid, have been measured
%Romulus% by the CLEO and ARGUS. It is almost impossible to measure the \B-meson lifetime measurement
%Romulus% with time-integrated technique. The best approach for measuring the \B-meson lifetime 
%Romulus% is using the time dependent measurement at asymmetric \B factories such as \babar and
%Romulus% Belle. 
At asymmetric \B factories the \Ups meson is boosted
resulting in \B and \particle{\bar{B}} moving nearly parallel to each 
other with the same boost. The lifetime is inferred from the distance $\Delta z$        
separating the \B and \particle{\bar{B}} decay vertices along the beam axis 
%Romulus% (see \Fig{Ups_geometry})
and from the \Ups boost known from the beam energies. This boost is equal to 
$\beta \gamma \approx 0.55$ (0.43) in the \babar (\belle) experiment,
resulting in an average \B decay length of approximately 250~(190)~$\mu$m. 
%Romulus% \begin{figure}
%Romulus% \begin{center}
%Romulus% \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/life_mix/Ups_geometry}
%Romulus% \caption{\Ups decay in the laboratory frame where one \B meson is fully 
%Romulus% reconstructed}
%Romulus% \labf{Ups_geometry}
%Romulus% \end{center}
%Romulus% \end{figure}

%Romulus% At asymmetric \B factories, the \Ups decays only to a pair of \B mesons since the mass of 
%Romulus% the \Ups is about 22 $MeV$ above \B-meson pair with no additional pions or any other
%Romulus% type of $b$ hadrons produced.  Both \B mesons produced from the \Ups decays move away 
%Romulus% from the production vertex nearly parallel to each other by a few hundred microns before
%Romulus% decaying due to a boost in the beam direction. For \babar the boost is $<\beta \gamma> \approx 0.55$ and
%Romulus% for Belle is $<\beta \gamma> \approx 0.43$. The lifetime is inferred from the distance $\Delta z$
%Romulus% separating \B and \particle{\bar{B}} decay vertexes and \Ups boost
%Romulus% known from colliding beam energies.  

%OS In order to maximize the
%OS precision of the measurement, one \B meson is reconstructed in the
%OS \particle{D^{(*)}\ell\nu_{\ell}} decay.  The other \B is typically not
%OS fully reconstructed, only position of its decay vertex is determined.

%Romulus% The geometry of an \Ups decay to a pair of \B mesons in which one \B meson is fully 
%Romulus% reconstructed is shown in \Fig{Ups_geometry}. 
%Romulus% At \babar the average decay length is of the order of 
%Romulus% 250~$\mu$m and the uncertainty for a vertex point are about $\approx$ 50~$\mu$m for a fully
%Romulus% reconstructed \B meson and $\approx 100~\mu$m for a partially reconstructed \B meson.
In order to determine the charge of the \B mesons in each event, one of them is
fully reconstructed in a semileptonic or hadronic decay mode.
The other \B is typically not fully reconstructed, only the position
of its decay vertex is determined from the remaining tracks in the event.
These measurements benefit from large statistics, but suffer from poor proper time 
resolution, comparable to the \B lifetime itself. This resolution is dominated by the 
uncertainty on the decay vertices, which is typically 50~(100)~$\mu$m for a
fully (partially) reconstructed \B meson. 
%Romulus% $\Delta z$ resolution.
%Romulus% At asymmetric \B factories, the decay time different resolution is dominated by the uncertainty 
%Romulus% of the vertex location of both \B mesons. The decay distance and the momenta of a \B meson 
%Romulus% determine its lifetime. In order to determine the charge of the \B mesons in each event,
%Romulus% one of the them is fully reconstructed in semileptonic or fully hadronic decay modes.
%Romulus% The other \B is typically not fully reconstructed, only the position
%Romulus% of its decay vertex is determined from the remaining tracks in the event.
%Romulus% These measurements benefit from very large statistics, but suffer from
%Romulus% poor $\Delta z$ resolution (the distance between the two \B-meson decay
%Romulus% vertexes projected on the beam axis.
%Romulus% Alternatively one could apply a completely 
%Romulus% reconstructed events where both \B are fully reconstructed for getting the best
%Romulus% precision on the lifetime measurement, however, a price has to be paid due to 
%Romulus% a low statistics. 
With very large future statistics,
the resolution and purity could be improved (and hence the systematics reduced)
by fully reconstructing both \B mesons in the event. 
 
\item {\bf\em Direct measurement of lifetime ratios}.  This method, 
  initially applied 
  in the measurement of $\tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)$, is now also used for other 
  \b-hadron species at the LHC. 
  The ratio of the lifetimes is extracted from the proper time 
  dependence of the ratio of the observed yields of 
  of two different \b-hadron species, 
  both reconstructed in decay modes with similar topologies. 
  The advantage of this method is that subtle efficiency effects
  (partially) cancel in the ratio. 
\end{enumerate}

In some of the latest analyses, measurements of two (\eg\ $\tau(\Bu)$ and
$\tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)$) or three (\eg\ $\tau(\Bu)$,
$\tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)$, and \dmd) quantities are combined.  This
introduces correlations among measurements.  Another source of
correlations among the measurements are the systematic effects, which
could be common to an experiment or to an analysis technique across the
experiments.  When calculating the averages, such correlations are taken
into account following the general procedure described in
\Ref{LEPBOSC:1996}.

\mysubsubsection{Inclusive \b-hadron lifetimes}
%% ====================================================================

The inclusive \b hadron lifetime is defined as $\tau_{\b} = \sum_i f_i
\tau_i$ where $\tau_i$ are the individual species lifetimes and $f_i$ are
the fractions of the various species present in an unbiased sample of
weakly decaying \b hadrons produced at a high-energy
collider.\footnote{In principle such a quantity could be slightly
different in \particle{Z} decays, at the Tevatron or at the LHC, 
% (it has not been measured at the LHC),
in case the
fractions of \b-hadron species are not exactly the same; see the
discussion in \Sec{fractions_high_energy}.}  This quantity is certainly
less fundamental than the lifetimes of the individual species, the
latter being much more useful in comparisons of the measurements with
the theoretical predictions.  Nonetheless, we perform the averaging of
the inclusive lifetime measurements for completeness as well as for the
reason that they might be of interest as ``technical numbers.''

In practice, an unbiased measurement of the inclusive lifetime is
difficult to achieve, because it would imply an efficiency which is
guaranteed to be the same across species.  So most of the measurements
are biased.  In an attempt to group analyses which are expected to
select the same mixture of \b hadrons, the available results (given in
\Table{lifeincl}) are divided into the following three sets:
\begin{enumerate}
\item measurements at LEP and SLD that accept any \b-hadron decay, based 
      on topological reconstruction (secondary vertex or track impact
      parameters);
\item measurements at LEP based on the identification
      of a lepton from a \b decay; and
\item measurements at the Tevatron based on inclusive 
      \particle{H_b\to \jpsi X} reconstruction, where the
      \particle{\jpsi} is fully reconstructed.
\end{enumerate}

The measurements of the first set are generally considered as estimates
of $\tau_{\b}$, although the efficiency to reconstruct a secondary
vertex most probably depends, in an analysis-specific way, on the number
of tracks coming from the vertex, thereby depending on the type of the
$H_b$.  Even though these efficiency variations can in principle be
accounted for using Monte Carlo simulations (which inevitably contain
assumptions on branching fractions), the $H_b$ mixture in that case can
remain somewhat ill-defined and could be slightly different among
analyses in this set.

On the contrary, the mixtures corresponding to the other two sets of
measurements are better defined in the limit where the reconstruction
and selection efficiency of a lepton or a \particle{\jpsi} from an
$H_b$ does not depend on the decaying hadron type.  These mixtures are
given by the production fractions and the inclusive branching fractions
for each $H_b$ species to give a lepton or a \particle{\jpsi}.  In
particular, under the assumption that all \b hadrons have the same
semileptonic decay width, the analyses of the second set should measure
$\tau(\b\to\ell) = (\sum_i f_i \tau_i^3) /(\sum_i f_i \tau_i^2)$ which is
necessarily larger than $\tau_{\b}$ if lifetime differences exist.
Given the present knowledge on $\tau_i$ and $f_i$,
$\tau(\b\to\ell)-\tau_{\b}$ is expected to be of the order of 0.003\ps.
On the other hand, the third set measuring $\tau(\b\to\particle{\jpsi})$
is expected to give an average smaller than $\tau_{\b}$ because 
of the \Bc meson which has a significantly
larger probability to decay to a \particle{\jpsi}
than other \b-hadron species. 

Measurements by SLC and LEP experiments are subject to a number of
common systematic uncertainties, such as those due to (lack of knowledge
of) \b and \particle{c} fragmentation, \b and \particle{c} decay models,
\BR{B\to\ell}, \BR{B\to c\to\ell}, \BR{c\to\ell}, $\tau_{\particle{c}}$,
and $H_b$ decay multiplicity.  In the averaging, these systematic
uncertainties are assumed to be 100\% correlated.  The averages for the
sets defined above (also given in \Table{lifeincl}) are
\begin{eqnarray}
\tau(\b~\mbox{vertex}) &=& \hfagTAUBVTX \,, \labe{TAUBVTX} \\
\tau(\b\to\ell) &=& \hfagTAUBLEP  \,, \\
\tau(\b\to\particle{\jpsi}) &=& \hfagTAUBJP\,.
\end{eqnarray}
% whereas an average of all measurements, ignoring mixture differences, 
% yields \hfagTAUB.

After a number of years of dominating these averages the LEP experiments
yielded the scene to the asymmetric \B~factories and
the Tevatron experiments. The \B~factories have been very successful in
utilizing their potential -- in only a few years of running, \babar and,
to a greater extent, \belle, have struck a balance between the
statistical and the systematic uncertainties, with both being close to
(or even better than) the impressive 1\%.  In the meanwhile, CDF and
\dzero have emerged as significant contributors to the field as the
Tevatron Run~II data flowed in. Recently, the LHCb experiment reached 
a further step in precision, improving by a factor $\sim 2 $ 
over the previous best measurement. 

% Both appear to enjoy relatively small
% systematic effects, and while current statistical uncertainties of their
% measurements are factors of 2 to 4 larger than those of their \B-factory
% counterparts, both Tevatron experiments stand to increase their samples
% by almost an order of magnitude.


At present time we are in an interesting position of having three sets
of measurements (from LEP/SLC, \B factories and the Tevatron) that
originate from different environments, obtained using substantially
different techniques and are precise enough for incisive comparison.

% While individual lifetimes are often of interest to experiments, \eg\ in
% extraction of CKM matrix elements, the ratios of the lifetimes are more
% interesting from the theoretical perspective as they are predicted more
% precisely.

The averaging of $\tau(\Bu)$, $\tau(\Bd)$ and $\tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)$
measurements is summarized\footnote{%
We do not include the old unpublished measurements of Refs.~\cite{CDFnote7514:2005,CDFnote7386:2005}.}
in \Tablesss{lifebd}{lifebu}{liferatioBuBd}.
For $\tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)$ we average only the measurements of this
quantity provided by experiments rather than using all available
knowledge, which would have included, for example, $\tau(\Bu)$ and
$\tau(\Bd)$ measurements which did not contribute to any of the ratio
measurements.

The following sources of correlated (within experiment/machine)
systematic uncertainties have been considered:
% (central values and errors scaled accordingly):
\begin{itemize}
\item for SLC/LEP measurements -- \particle{D^{**}} branching ratio uncertainties~\cite{Abbaneo:2000ej_mod,*Abbaneo:2001bv_mod_cont},
momentum estimation of \b mesons from \particle{Z^0} decays
(\b-quark fragmentation parameter $\langle X_E \rangle = 0.702 \pm 0.008$~\cite{Abbaneo:2000ej_mod,*Abbaneo:2001bv_mod_cont}),
\Bs and \b-baryon lifetimes (see \Secss{taubs}{taulb}),
and \b-hadron fractions at high energy (see \Table{fractions}); 
\item for \babar measurements -- alignment, $z$ scale, PEP-II boost,
sample composition (where applicable);
\item for \dzero and CDF Run~II measurements -- alignment (separately
within each experiment).
\end{itemize}
The resultant averages are:
\begin{eqnarray}
\tau(\Bd) & = & \hfagTAUBD \,, \\
\tau(\Bu) & = & \hfagTAUBU \,, \\
\tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd) & = & \hfagRTAUBU \,.
\end{eqnarray}
