\labs{life_mix}

% ----------------------------
% Introduction to this chapter
% ----------------------------

Quantities such as \b-hadron production fractions, \b-hadron lifetimes, 
and neutral \B-meson oscillation frequencies have been studied
in the nineties at LEP and SLC %%% for many years at high-energy colliders, namely at LEP and SLC 
(\ee colliders at $\sqrt{s}=m_{\particle{Z}}$) 
as well as at the 
first version of the Tevatron
(\particle{p\bar{p}} collider at $\sqrt{s}=1.8\TeV$). 
Since then 
precise measurements of the \Bd and \Bu mesons
% lifetimes, as well as of the \Bd oscillation frequency,
have also been performed at the 
asymmetric \B factories, KEKB and PEPII
(\ee colliders at $\sqrt{s}=m_{\Ups}$) while measurements related 
to the other \b-hadrons, in particular \Bs, \Bc and \Lb, 
have been performed at the upgraded Tevatron ($\sqrt{s}=1.96\TeV$)
and are continuing at the LHC ($pp$ collider at $\sqrt{s}=7\TeV$).
In most cases, these basic quantities, although interesting by themselves,
became necessary ingredients for the more complicated and 
refined analyses at the asymmetric \B factories, 
the Tevatron and the LHC,
in particular the time-dependent \CP asymmetry measurements.
It is therefore important that the best experimental
values of these quantities continue to be kept up-to-date and improved. 

In several cases, the averages presented in this chapter are 
needed and used as input for the results given in the subsequent chapters. 
Within this chapter, some averages need the knowledge of other 
averages in a circular way. This coupling, which appears through the 
\b-hadron fractions whenever inclusive or semi-exclusive measurements 
have to be considered, has reduced drastically in the past several years 
with increasingly precise exclusive measurements becoming available
and dominating practically all averages. 

In addition to \b-hadron fractions, lifetimes and 
mixing parameters, this chapter also deals with the 
\CP-violating phase $\phiccbars\simeq -2\beta_s$, which is the phase 
difference between the \Bs mixing amplitude and the 
$b\to c\bar{c}s$ decay amplitude. The angle $\beta$, 
which is the equivalent of $\beta_s$ for the \Bd 
system, is discussed in Chapter~\ref{sec:cp_uta}.

\mysubsection{\b-hadron production fractions}
% ----------------------------------------
\labs{fractions}
 
We consider here the relative fractions of the different \b-hadron 
species found in an unbiased sample of weakly-decaying \b hadrons 
produced under some specific conditions. The knowledge of these fractions
is useful to characterize the signal composition in inclusive \b-hadron 
analyses, to predict the background composition in exclusive analyses, 
or to convert (relative) observe rates into (relative) branching fraction 
measurements. 
Many \B-physics analyses need these fractions as input. We distinguish 
here the following three conditions: \Ups decays, \Upsfive decays, and 
high-energy collisions (including \Z decays). 

% -------------------------------------------------------------
\mysubsubsection{\b-hadron production fractions in \Ups decays}
% -------------------------------------------------------------
\labs{fraction_Ups4S}

Only pairs of the two lightest (charged and neutral) \B mesons 
can be produced in \Ups decays, 
and it is enough to determine the following branching 
fractions:
\begin{eqnarray}
f^{+-} & = & \Gamma(\Ups \to \particle{B^+B^-})/
             \Gamma_{\rm tot}(\Ups)  \,, \\
f^{00} & = & \Gamma(\Ups \to \particle{B^0\bar{B}^0})/
             \Gamma_{\rm tot}(\Ups) \,.
\end{eqnarray}
In practice, most analyses measure their ratio
\begin{equation}
R^{+-/00} = f^{+-}/f^{00} = \Gamma(\Ups \to \particle{B^+B^-})/
             \Gamma(\Ups \to \particle{B^0\bar{B}^0}) \,,
\end{equation}
which is easier to access experimentally.
Since an inclusive (but separate) reconstruction of 
\Bu and \Bd is difficult, specific exclusive decay modes, 
${\Bu} \to x^+$ and ${\Bd} \to x^0$, are usually considered to perform 
a measurement of $R^{+-/00}$, whenever they can be related by 
isospin symmetry (for example \particle{\Bu \to \jpsi K^+} and 
\particle{\Bd \to \jpsi K^0}).
Under the assumption that $\Gamma(\Bu \to x^+) = \Gamma(\Bd \to x^0)$, 
\ie\ that isospin invariance holds in these \B decays,
the ratio of the number of reconstructed
$\Bu \to x^+$ and $\Bd \to x^0$ mesons is proportional to
\begin{equation}
\frac{f^{+-}\, \BR{\Bu\to x^+}}{f^{00}\, \BR{\Bd\to x^0}}
= \frac{f^{+-}\, \Gamma({\Bu}\to x^+)\, \tau(\Bu)}%
{f^{00}\, \Gamma({\Bd}\to x^0)\,\tau(\Bd)}
= \frac{f^{+-}}{f^{00}} \, \frac{\tau(\Bu)}{\tau(\Bd)}  \,, 
\end{equation} 
where $\tau(\Bu)$ and $\tau(\Bd)$ are the \Bu and \Bd 
lifetimes respectively.
Hence the primary quantity measured in these analyses 
is $R^{+-/00} \, \tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)$, 
and the extraction of $R^{+-/00}$ with this method therefore 
requires the knowledge of the $\tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)$ lifetime ratio.

\end{table}

The published measurements of $R^{+-/00}$ are listed 
in \Table{R_data} together with the corresponding assumed values of 
$\tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)$.
All measurements are based on the above-mentioned method, 
except the one from \belle, which is a by-product of the 
\Bd mixing frequency analysis using dilepton events
(but note that it also assumes isospin invariance, 
namely $\Gamma(\Bu \to \ell^+{\rm X}) = \Gamma(\Bd \to \ell^+{\rm X})$).
The latter is therefore treated in a slightly different 
manner in the following procedure used to combine 
these measurements:
\begin{itemize} 
\item each published value of $R^{+-/00}$ from CLEO and \babar
      is first converted back to the original measurement of 
      $R^{+-/00} \, \tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)$, using the value of the 
      lifetime ratio assumed in the corresponding analysis;
\item a simple weighted average of these original
      measurements of $R^{+-/00} \, \tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)$ from 
      CLEO and \babar (which do not depend on the assumed value 
      of the lifetime ratio) is then computed, assuming no 
      statistical or systematic correlations between them;

% {\em ***** this may not be true in the case of \babar;
% waiting for more information 
% from David about averaging of the two \babar results ****}
% \marginpar{David}

\item the weighted average of $R^{+-/00} \, \tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)$ 
      is converted into a value of $R^{+-/00}$, using the latest 
      average of the lifetime ratios, $\tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)=\hfagRTAUBU$ 
      (see \Sec{lifetime_ratio});
\item the \belle measurement of $R^{+-/00}$ is adjusted to the 
      current values of $\tau(\Bd)=\hfagTAUBD$ and 
      $\tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)=\hfagRTAUBU$ (see \Sec{lifetime_ratio}),
      using the quoted systematic uncertainties due to these parameters;
\item the combined value of $R^{+-/00}$ from CLEO and \babar is averaged 
      with the adjusted value of $R^{+-/00}$ from \belle, assuming a 100\% 
      correlation of the systematic uncertainty due to the limited 
      knowledge on $\tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)$; no other correlation is considered. 
\end{itemize} 
The resulting global average, 
\begin{equation}
R^{+-/00} = \frac{f^{+-}}{f^{00}} =  \hfagFF \,,
\labe{Rplusminus}
\end{equation}
is consistent with an equal production of charged and neutral \B mesons, 
although only at the $\hfagNSIGMAFF\,\sigma$ level.

On the other hand, the \babar collaboration has 
performed a direct measurement of the $f^{00}$ fraction 
using an original method, which does not rely on isospin symmetry nor requires 
the knowledge of $\tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)$. Its analysis, 
based on a comparison between the number of events where a single 
$B^0 \to D^{*-} \ell^+ \nu$ decay could be reconstructed and the number 
of events where two such decays could be reconstructed, yields~\cite{Aubert:2005bq}
\begin{equation}
f^{00}= 0.487 \pm 0.010\,\mbox{(stat)} \pm 0.008\,\mbox{(syst)} \,.
% f^{00}= \hfagFNN \,.
\labe{fzerozero}
\end{equation}

The two results of \Eqss{Rplusminus}{fzerozero} are of very different natures 
and completely independent of each other. 
Their product is equal to $f^{+-} = \hfagFPROD$, 
while another combination of them gives $f^{+-} + f^{00}= \hfagFSUM$, 
compatible with unity.
Assuming\footnote{A few non-$\B\bar{B}$
decay modes of the $\Upsilon(4S)$ 
($\Upsilon(1S)\pi^+\pi^-$,
$\Upsilon(2S)\pi^+\pi^-$, $\Upsilon(1S)\eta$) 
have been observed with branching fractions
of the order of $10^{-4}$~\cite{Aubert:2006bm,*Sokolov:2006sd,*Aubert_mod:2008bv},
corresponding to a partial
width several times larger than that in the \ee channel.
However, this can still be
neglected and the assumption $f^{+-}+f^{00}=1$ remains valid
in the present context of the determination of $f^{+-}$ and $f^{00}$.}
 $f^{+-}+f^{00}= 1$, also consistent with 
CLEO's observation that the fraction of \Ups decays 
to \BB pairs is larger than 0.96 at \CL{95}~\cite{Barish:1995cx},
the results of \Eqss{Rplusminus}{fzerozero}
can be averaged (first converting \Eq{Rplusminus} 
into a value of $f^{00}=1/(R^{+-/00}+1)$) 
to yield the following more precise estimates:
\begin{equation}
f^{00} = \hfagFNW  \,,~~~ f^{+-} = 1 -f^{00} =  \hfagFCW \,,~~~
\frac{f^{+-}}{f^{00}} =  \hfagFFW \,.
\end{equation}
The latter ratio differs from one by $\hfagNSIGMAFFW\,\sigma$.

\newcommand{\fsfive}{\ensuremath{f^{\Upsfive}_{s}}}
\newcommand{\fudfive}{\ensuremath{f^{\Upsfive}_{u,d}}}
\newcommand{\fnBfive}{\ensuremath{f^{\Upsfive}_{B\!\!\!\!/}}}

Hadronic events produced in $e^+e^-$ collisions at the \Upsfive energy
can be classified into three categories: 
light-quark ($u$, $d$, $s$, $c$) continuum events, $b\bar{b}$ continuum events,
and \Upsfive events. The latter two cannot be distinguished and will be called
$b\bar{b}$ events in the following. These $b\bar{b}$ events, which also include 
$b\bar{b}\gamma$ events because of possible initial-state radiation, 
can hadronize in different final states.
We define \fudfive\ as
the fraction of $b\bar{b}$ events with a pair of non-strange 
bottom mesons 
($B\bar{B}$, $B\bar{B}^*$, $B^*\bar{B}$, $B^*\bar{B}^*$,
$B\bar{B}\pi$, $B\bar{B}^*\pi$, $B^*\bar{B}\pi$,
$B^*\bar{B}^*\pi$, and $B\bar{B}\pi\pi$ final states, 
where
$B$ denotes a $B^0$ or $B^+$ meson and 
$\bar{B}$ denotes a $\bar{B}^0$ or $B^-$ meson), \fsfive\ as
the fraction of $b\bar{b}$ events with a pair of strange bottom mesons
($B_s^0\bar{B}_s^0$, $B_s^0\bar{B}_s^{0*}$, $B_s^{0*}\bar{B}_s^0$, and
$B_s^{0*}\bar{B}_s^{0*}$ final states), and 
\fnBfive\ as the fraction of $b\bar{b}$ events without 
bottom meson in the final state.
Note that the excited bottom-meson states decay via $B^* \to B \gamma$ and
$B_s^{0*} \to B_s^0 \gamma$.
These fractions satisfy
\begin{equation}
\fudfive + \fsfive + \fnBfive = 1 \,.
\labe{sum_frac_five}
\end{equation}

This extraction was performed 
under the implicit assumption

\begin{equation}

${\cal B}(\Upsfive\to D^0 X)$ and ${\cal B}(\Upsfive\to \phi X)$.
%%For completeness, %RL
We list also in \Table{fsFiveS} 
the values of \fsfive\ derived from measurements of
$\fudfive={\cal B}(\Upsfive\to B\bar BX)$~\cite{Huang:2006em_mod,Drutskoy:2010an}, as well as our average value of  \fsfive,
all obtained under the assumption $\fnBfive=0$.

However, the assumption $\fnBfive=0$ is no longer valid since the observation of
the following final states in $e^+e^-$ collisions at the \Upsfive\ energy:
$\Upsilon(1S)\pi^+\pi^-$,
$\Upsilon(2S)\pi^+\pi^-$,
$\Upsilon(3S)\pi^+\pi^-$
and
$\Upsilon(1S)K^+K^-$~\cite{Abe:2007tk,Garmash:2014dhx_mod},
$h_b(1P)\pi^+\pi^-$ and 
$h_b(2P)\pi^+\pi^-$~\cite{Adachi:2011ji},
and more recently 
$\Upsilon(1S)\pi^0\pi^0$,
$\Upsilon(2S)\pi^0\pi^0$ 
and
$\Upsilon(3S)\pi^0\pi^0$~\cite{Krokovny:2013mgx}.
The sum of the mesaurements of the corresponding visible cross-sections,
adding also the contributions of the unmeasured
$\Upsilon(1S)K^0\bar{K}^0$, $h_b(1P)\pi^0\pi^0$ and $h_b(2P)\pi^0\pi^0$ final states
assuming isospin conservation, amounts to
$$

We divide this by the $\b\bar{\b}$ production cross section, 
$\sigma(e^+e^- \to \b\bar{\b} X) = 337 \pm 15$~pb, obtained as the average of the 
CLEO~\cite{Artuso:2005xw} and Belle~\cite{Esen:2012yz_mod} measurements, to obtain

The production of $B^0_s$ mesons at the \Upsfive

channel, %~\cite{Bonvicini:2005ci,Drutskoy:2006xc,Louvot:2008sc},
with $\sigma(e^+e^- \to B_s^{0*}\bar{B}_s^{0*})/%
\sigma(e^+e^- \to B_s^{0(*)}\bar{B}_s^{0(*)})
= (87.0\pm 1.7)\%$~\cite{Li:2011pg,Louvot:2008sc}.
% = (90.1^{+3.8}_{-4.0}\pm 0.2)\%$~\cite{Louvot:2008sc}.
The proportion of the various production channels 
for non-strange $B$ mesons have also been measured~\cite{Drutskoy:2010an}.

\mysubsubsection{\b-hadron production fractions at high energy}
%--------------------------------------------------------------
\labs{fractions_high_energy}
\labs{chibar}

At high energy, all species of weakly-decaying \b hadrons 
may be produced, either directly or in strong and electromagnetic 
decays of excited \b hadrons. It is often assumed that the fractions 
of these different species are the same in unbiased samples of 
high-$p_{\rm T}$ \b jets originating from \particle{Z^0} decays, 
from \particle{p\bar{p}} collisions at the Tevatron, or from 
\particle{p p} collisions at the LHC.
This hypothesis is plausible under the condition that the square of
the momentum transfer to the produced \b quarks, $Q^2$, is large compared 
with the square of the hadronization energy scale, 
$Q^2 \gg \Lambda_{\rm QCD}^2$.
On the other hand, there is no strong argument to claim that the
fractions at different machines should be strictly equal, so 
this assumption should be checked experimentally. Although the 
available data is not sufficient at this time to perform a definitive
check, it is expected that more refined analyses of the Tevatron Run~II data 
and new analyses from LHC 
experiments may improve this situation and allow one to confirm or 
disprove this assumption with reasonable confidence. Meanwhile, the 
attitude adopted here is that these fractions are assumed to be equal 
at all high-energy colliders until demonstrated otherwise by 
experiment.
%%% \footnote{Both CDF and 
%%% LHCb report a $p_{\rm T}$ dependence for $\Lambda_b$ production relative to
%%% ${\Bu}$ and ${\Bd}$.  The reported $p_{\rm T}$ dependence enhances the 
%%% number of $\Lambda_b$s observed at low-$p_{\rm T}$ compared with the
%%% LEP results.}
%%% However, as explained below, the measurements performed at LEP, at 
%%% the Tevatron and from LHCb show discrepancies.
Both CDF and LHCb report a $p_{\rm T}$ dependence for $\Lambda_b$
production relative to \Bu and \Bd; the number of $\Lambda_b$ baryons
observed at low $p_{\rm T}$ is enhanced with respect to that 
seen at LEP's higher $p_{\rm T}$.
Therefore we present 
three sets of complete averages: one set including only measurements 
performed at LEP, a second set including only measurements performed 
at the Tevatron, a third  set including measurements performed at LEP, 
Tevatron and LHCb.  The LHCb production fractions results, by themselves, 
are still incomplete, lacking measurements on the production of other weakly 
decaying heavy flavour baryons, $\Xi_b$ and $\Omega_b$, and a measurement of 
$\overline{\chi}$ giving an extra constraint between \fBd and \fBs.

Contrary to what happens in the charm sector where the fractions of 
\particle{D^+} and \particle{D^0} are different, the relative amount 
of \Bu and \Bd is not affected by the electromagnetic decays of 
excited ${\Bu}^*$ and ${\Bd}^*$ states and strong decays of excited 
${\Bu}^{**}$ and ${\Bd}^{**}$ states. Decays of the type 
\particle{{\Bs}^{**} \to B^{(*)}K} also contribute to the \Bu and \Bd rates, 
but with the same magnitude if mass effects can be neglected.  
We therefore assume equal production of \Bu and \Bd. We also  
neglect the production of weakly-decaying states
made of several heavy quarks (like \Bc and other heavy baryons) 
which is known to be very small. Hence, for the purpose of determining 
the \b-hadron fractions, we use the constraints
\begin{equation}
\fBu = \fBd ~~~~\mbox{and}~~~ \fBu + \fBd + \fBs + \fbb = 1 \,,
\labe{constraints}
\end{equation}
where \fBu, \fBd, \fBs and \fbb
are the unbiased fractions of \Bu, \Bd, \Bs and \b baryons, respectively.

The LEP experiments have measured
$\fBs \times \BR{\Bs\to\particle{D_s^-} \ell^+ \nu_\ell \mbox{$X$}}$~\cite{Abreu:1992rv,*Acton:1992zq,*Buskulic:1995bd}, 
$\BR{\b\to\Lb} \times \BR{\Lb\to\Lc\ell^-\bar{\nu}_\ell \mbox{$X$}}$~\cite{Abreu:1995me,Barate:1997if}
and $\BR{\b\to\Xib^-} \times \BR{\Xi_b^- \to \Xi^-\ell^-\overline\nu_\ell 
\mbox{$X$}}$~\cite{Buskulic:1996sm,Abdallah:2005cw}\footnote{
  \label{foot:life_mix:Abdallah:2005cw}
  The DELPHI result of \Ref{Abdallah:2005cw} is considered to supersede an older one~\cite{Abreu:1995kt}.
} 
from partially reconstructed final states including a lepton, \fbb
from protons identified in \b events~\cite{Barate:1997ty}, and the 
production rate of charged \b hadrons~\cite{Abdallah:2003xp}. 
Ratios of \b-hadron fractions have been measured at CDF using 
lepton+charm final 
states~\cite{Affolder:1999iq,Aaltonen:2008zd,Aaltonen:2008eu}\footnote{
  \label{foot:life_mix:Affolder:1999iq}
  CDF updated their measurement of \fLb/\fBd~\cite{Affolder:1999iq} to account 
  for a measured $p_{\rm T}$ dependence between exclusively reconstructed 
  $\Lambda_b$ and $B^0$~\cite{Aaltonen:2008eu}.
}, double semileptonic decays 
with \particle{K^*\mu\mu} and \particle{\phi\mu\mu}
final states~\cite{Abe:1999ta},
and fully reconstructed $\Bs\to\jpsi\phi$ decays~\cite{CDFnote10795:2012}.
Measurements of the production of other heavy 
flavour baryons at the Tevatron are included in the determination of 
\fbb~\cite{Abazov_mod:2007ub,Abazov:2008qm,Aaltonen:2009ny}\footnote{
  \label{foot:life_mix:Abazov:2008qm}
  \dzero reports $f_{\Omega_b^-}/f_{\Xi_b^-}$.  We use the CDF+\dzero average of 
  $f_{\Xi_b^-}/f_{\Lambda_b}$ to obtain $f_{\Omega_b^-}/f_{\Lambda_b}$ and then 
  combine with the CDF result.
} using the constraint
\begin{eqnarray}
\fbb & = & f_{\Lambda_b} + f_{\Xi_b^0} + f_{\Xi_b^-} + f_{\Omega_b^-} 
     \nonumber \\
     & = & f_{\Lambda_b}\left(1 + 2\frac{f_{\Xi_b^-}}{f_{\Lambda_b}} 
           + \frac{f_{\Omega_b^-}}{f_{\Lambda_b}}\right),
\end{eqnarray}
where isospin invariance is assumed in the production of $\Xi_b^0$ and 
$\Xi_b^-$. Other \b-baryons are expected to decay strongly or 
electromagnetically to those baryons listed. For the production 
measurements, both CDF and \dzero\ reconstruct their \b-baryons exclusively 
to final states which include a $\jpsi$ and a hyperon 
($\Lambda_b\rightarrow \jpsi \Lambda$, 
$\Xi_b^- \rightarrow \jpsi \Xi^-$ and 
$\Omega_b^- \rightarrow \jpsi \Omega^-$).  
We assume that the partial decay width of a \b-baryon to a $\jpsi$ and the 
corresponding hyperon is equal to the partial width of any other \b-baryon to 
a $\jpsi$ and the corresponding hyperon.  LHCb has also measured
ratios of \b-hadron fractions in charm+lepton final states~\cite{Aaij:2011jp} 
and in fully reconstructed hadronic two-body decays $\Bd \to D^+\pi^-$, $\Bs \to \Ds \pi^-$ and 
$\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \pi^-$~\cite{Aaij:2013qqa,Aaij:2014jyk}.\footnote{
  The result of Ref.~\cite{Aaij:2013qqa} supersedes that of Ref.~\cite{Aaij:2011hi}.
}

Both CDF and LHCb observe that the ratio $\fLb/\fBd$ depends on the $p_{\rm T}$
of the charm+lepton system~\cite{Aaltonen:2008eu,Aaij:2011jp}%
\footnote{
  \label{foot:life_mix:Aaltonen:2008eu}
  CDF compares the $p_{\rm T}$ distribution of fully reconstructed 
  $\Lambda_b\rightarrow\Lambda_c^+ \pi^-$ 
  with $\overline{B^0}\rightarrow\D^+\pi^-$ which 
  compares $\fLb/\fBd$ up to a scale factor. LHCb compares the $p_{\rm T}$ 
  in the charm+lepton system between $\Lambda_b$ and \Bd and \Bu comparing 
  $R_{\Lambda_b}/2 = \fLb/(\fBu+\fBd) = \fLb/2\fBd$.}. 
CDF chose to correct an older result to account for the $p_{\rm T}$ dependence.
In a second result, CDF binned their data in $p_{\rm T}$ of the charm+electron 
system~\cite{Aaltonen:2008zd}.
The more recent LHCb measurement using hadronic decays~\cite{Aaij:2014jyk} 
obtains the scale for $R_{\Lambda_b} = \fLb/\fBd$ from their previous 
charm + lepton data~\cite{Aaij:2011jp}.  The LHCb measurement using hadronic
data also bins those same data in pseudorapidity ($\eta$) and sees a 
linear dependence of $R_{\Lambda_b}$.  Since $\eta$ is not entirely
independent of $p_{\rm T}$ it is impossible at this time to tell whether 
this dependence just an artifact of the $p_{\rm T}$ dependence.
\Figure{rlb_comb} shows the ratio $R_{\Lambda_b}$ as a function of 
$p_{\rm T}$ for the \b hadron, as measured by LHCb.  LHCb fits their
scaled hadronic data to obtain,
\begin{equation}
R_{\Lambda_b} = (0.151\pm 0.030) + 
  \exp{\left\{-(0.57\pm 0.11) - 
  (0.095\pm 0.016)[{\rm GeV}/c]^{-1} \times p_{\rm T}\right\}}.
\end{equation}
A value of
$R_{\Lambda_b}$ is also calculated for LEP and placed at the approximate $p_{\rm T}$ for the charm+lepton
system, but this value does not participate in any fit\footnote{
  \label{foot:life_mix:Aaltonen:2008zd}
  The CDF semileptonic data would require significant corrections to obtain the $p_{\rm T}$ of the \b hadron and be included on the same plot with the LHCb data.
  We do not have these corrections at this time.}.
Because the two LHCb results for $R_{\Lambda_b}$ are not 
independent, we use only their semileptonic data for the averages.
Note that the $p_{\rm T}$ dependence
of $R_{\Lambda_b}$ combined with the constraint in \Eq{constraints} implies
a compensating $p_{\rm T}$ dependence in one or more of the production fractions, \fBu, \fBd,
or \fBs.

\end{figure}

Both CDF and LHCb have investigated the $p_{\rm T}$ dependence of $\fBs/\fBd$ using fully 
reconstructed $\Bs$ and $\Bd$ decays.  The CDF analysis reconstructed decays that include 
a $J/\psi$ in the final state~\cite{CDFnote10795:2012} and reports no significant $p_{\rm T}$ dependence 
on the ratio.  However, their result is dominated by an $18$\% scale uncertainty
from preliminary measurements of the branching ratios of the $\BR{\Bs\to J/\psi \phi}$ and 
$\BR{\Bd\to J\psi K^{*}(892)}$.
LHCb reported $3\sigma$ evidence that the ratio $\fBs/\fBd$ decreases with 
$p_{\rm T}$ using fully reconstructed $\Bs$ and $\Bd$ decays and theoretical predictions for branching ratios~\cite{Aaij:2013qqa}. \Figure{rs_comb} shows
the ratio $R_s = \fBs/\fBu$ as a function of $p_{\rm T}$ measured by CDF and LHCb.
Two fits are performed similar to the result for $R_{\Lambda_b}$ above.  The first
fit using a linear parameterization yields
$R_s = (0.2760\pm 0.0068) - (0.00191\pm 0.00059)\times p_{\rm T}$.  
A second fit using a simple exponential yields
$R_s = \exp\left\{(-1.293\pm 0.028) - (0.0077\pm 0.0025)\times p_{\rm T}\right\}$.  
The two fits are nearly indistinguisible over the $p_{\rm T}$ range of the results
but the second gives a physical value for all $p_{\rm T}$.  $R_s$ is also calculated
for LEP and placed at the approximate $p_{\rm T}$ for the $b$ hadron, though the LEP result
doesn't participate in the fit.  The PDG world average for $R_s$ is also included in the
figure for reference.

In order to combine or compare LHCb results with other experiments,
the $p_{\rm T}$-dependent $\fLb/(\fBu + \fBd)$ is weighted by the $p_{\rm T}$ spectrum\footnote{
  \label{foot:life_mix:Aaij:2011jp}
  In practice the LHCb data are given in 14 bins in $p_{\rm T}$ and $\eta$ with a full covariance matrix~\cite{Aaij:2011jp}. 
  The weighted average is calculated as
  $D^T C^{-1} M/\sigma$, where $\sigma = D^T C^{-1} D$, $M$ is a vector 
  of measurements, $C^{-1}$ is the inverse covariance matrix and $D^T$ is the 
  transpose of the design matrix (vector of 1's)}. 
\Table{LHCBcomp} compares 
the $p_{\rm T}$-weighted LHCb data with comparable averages from CDF. 
The average CDF 
and LHCb data are in good agreement despite the \b hadrons being produced 
in different kinematic regimes.

All these published results have been combined
%\footnote{%
%The latest preliminary results from CDF using $\Bs\to\jpsi\phi$ decays~\cite{CDFnote10795:2012}
%have not been included yet in our averages.
%}
following the procedure and 
assumptions described in \Ref{Abbaneo:2000ej_mod,*Abbaneo:2001bv_mod_cont},
to yield $\fBu=\fBd=\hfagWFBDNOMIX$, 
$\fBs=\hfagWFBSNOMIX$ and $\fbb=\hfagWFBBNOMIX$
under the constraints of \Eq{constraints}.  
%Following the PDG prescription, we have scaled the combined uncertainties 
%on these fractions by \hfagWFSFACTOR to account for slight discrepancies 
%in the input data. 
Repeating the combinations, for LEP and the Tevatron, we obtain 
$\fBu=\fBd=\hfagZFBDNOMIX$,
$\fBs=\hfagZFBSNOMIX$ and $\fbb=\hfagZFBBNOMIX$ when using the LEP data only,
$\fBu=\fBd=\hfagTFBDNOMIX$, $\fBs=\hfagTFBSNOMIX$ 
$\fbb = \hfagTFBBNOMIX$ when using the Tevatron data only.  As noted previously,
the LHCb data are insufficient to determine a complete set of \b-hadron production
fractions. The world averages (LEP, Tevatron and LHCb) for the various fractions 
are presented here for comparison with previous averages.  Significant differences
exist between the LEP and Tevatron fractions, therefore use of the world averages
should be taken with some care.
%When the Tevatron, 
%LHCb and LEP data are separated, we find no need to scale the uncertainties of 
%any combination.  
For these combinations other external inputs are used, 
\eg\ the branching ratios of \B mesons to final states with a \particle{D}, 
\particle{D^*} or \particle{D^{**}} in semileptonic decays, which are needed 
to evaluate the fraction of semileptonic \Bs decays with a \particle{D_s^-} 
in the final state.


Time-integrated mixing analyses performed with lepton pairs 
from \particle{b\bar{b}} 
events produced at high-energy colliders measure the quantity 
\begin{equation}
\chibar = f'_{\particle{d}} \,\chid + f'_{\particle{s}} \,\chis \,,
\labe{chibar}
\end{equation}
where $f'_{\particle{d}}$ and $f'_{\particle{s}}$ are 
the fractions of \Bd and \Bs hadrons 
in a sample of semileptonic \b-hadron decays, and where \chid and \chis 
are the \Bd and \Bs time-integrated mixing probabilities.
Assuming that all \b hadrons have the same semileptonic decay width implies 
$f'_i = f_i R_i$, where $R_i = \tau_i/\tau_{\b}$ is the ratio of the lifetime 
$\tau_i$ of species $i$ to the average \b-hadron lifetime 
$\tau_{\b} = \sum_i f_i \tau_i$.
Hence measurements of the mixing probabilities
\chibar, \chid and \chis can be used to improve our 
knowledge of \fBu, \fBd, \fBs and \fbb.
In practice, the above relations yield another determination of 
\fBs obtained from \fbb and mixing information, 
\begin{equation}
\fBs = \frac{1}{R_{\particle{s}}}
\frac{(1+r)\overline{\chi}-(1-\fbb R_{\rm baryon}) \chid}{(1+r)\chis - \chid} \,,
\labe{fBs-mixing}
\end{equation}
where $r=R_{\particle{u}}/R_{\particle{d}} = \tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)$.

The published measurements of \chibar performed by the LEP
experiments have been combined by the LEP Electroweak Working Group to yield 
$\chibar = \hfagCHIBARLEP$~\cite{LEPEWWG:2005ema_mod}.
This can be compared with the Tevatron average, $\chibar = \hfagCHIBARTEV$,
obtained from \dzero~\cite{Abazov:2006qw} and CDF~\cite{CDFnote10335:2011}
measurements with Run~II data.\footnote{
  \label{foot:life_mix:Acosta:2003ie_mod}
  As explained in \Ref{CDFnote10335:2011}, a previous CDF analysis~\cite{Acosta:2003ie_mod}
  performed with Run~I data overlooked a background component, so the corresponding result is not 
  included in the average.}
%old% The two averages deviate
%old% from each other by $\hfagCHIBARSFACTOR\,\sigma$; 
%old% this could be an indication that the production fractions of \b hadrons 
%old% at the \particle{Z} peak or at the Tevatron are not the same. 
%old% Although this discrepancy 
%old% is not very significant it should be carefully monitored in the future.

The two averages agree, showing no evidence that the production fractions
of \Bd and \Bs mesons at the \particle{Z} peak or at the Tevatron are different.
We combine these two results in a simple weighted average,
assuming no correlations, and obtain 
$\chibar = \hfagCHIBAR$.

Introducing the \chibar average in \Eq{fBs-mixing}, together with our world average 
$\chid = \hfagCHIDWU$ (see \Eq{chid} of \Sec{dmd}), the assumption $\chis= 1/2$ 
(justified by \Eq{chis} in \Sec{dms}), the 
best knowledge of the lifetimes (see \Sec{lifetimes}) and the estimate of \fbb given above, 
yields $\fBs = \hfagWFBSMIX$ 
(or $\fBs = \hfagZFBSMIX$ using only LEP data, 
or $\fBs = \hfagTFBSMIX$ using only Tevatron data),
an estimate dominated by the mixing information.

%------------------------------------------------
\labs{mixing}

The $\Bd-\Bdbar$ and $\Bs-\Bsbar$ systems
both exhibit the phenomenon of particle-antiparticle mixing. For each of them, 
there are two mass eigenstates which are linear combinations of the two flavour states,
\B and $\bar{\B}$. 
The heaviest (lightest) of the these mass states is denoted
$\B_{\rm H}$ ($\B_{\rm L}$),
with mass $m_{\rm H}$ ($m_{\rm L}$)
and total decay width $\Gamma_{\rm H}$ ($\Gamma_{\rm L}$). We define
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta m = m_{\rm H} - m_{\rm L} \,, &~~~~&  x = \Delta m/\Gamma \,, \labe{dm} \\
\Delta \Gamma \, = \Gamma_{\rm L} - \Gamma_{\rm H} \,, ~ &~~~~&  y= \Delta\Gamma/(2\Gamma) \,, \labe{dg}
\end{eqnarray}
where 
$\Gamma = (\Gamma_{\rm H} + \Gamma_{\rm L})/2 =1/\bar{\tau}(\B)$ 
is the average decay width.
$\Delta m$ is positive by definition, and 
$\Delta \Gamma$ is expected to be positive within
the Standard Model.\footnote{
  \label{foot:life_mix:Eqdg}
  For reason of symmetry in \Eqss{dm}{dg}, 
  $\Delta \Gamma$ is sometimes defined with the opposite sign. 
  The definition adopted here, \ie\
  \Eq{dg}, is the one used by most experimentalists and many
  phenomenologists in \B physics.}

There are four different time-dependent probabilities describing the 
case of a neutral \B meson produced 
as a flavour state and decaying to a flavour-specific final state.
If \CPT is conserved (which  
will be assumed throughout), they can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\cal P}(\B\to\B) & = &  \frac{e^{-\Gamma t}}{2} 
\left[ \cosh\!\left(\frac{\Delta\Gamma}{2}t\right) + \cos\!\left(\Delta m t\right)\right]  \\
{\cal P}(\B\to\bar{\B}) & = &  \frac{e^{-\Gamma t}}{2} 
\left[ \cosh\!\left(\frac{\Delta\Gamma}{2}t\right) - \cos\!\left(\Delta m t\right)\right] 
\left|\frac{q}{p}\right|^2 \\
{\cal P}(\bar{\B}\to\B) & = &  \frac{e^{-\Gamma t}}{2} 
\left[ \cosh\!\left(\frac{\Delta\Gamma}{2}t\right) - \cos\!\left(\Delta m t\right)\right] 
\left|\frac{p}{q}\right|^2 \\
{\cal P}(\bar{\B}\to\bar{\B}) & = &  \frac{e^{-\Gamma t}}{2} 
\left[ \cosh\!\left(\frac{\Delta\Gamma}{2}t\right) + \cos\!\left(\Delta m t\right)\right] 
\end{array} \right. \,,
\labe{oscillations}
\end{equation}
where $t$ is the proper time of the system (\ie\ the time interval between the production 
and the decay in the rest frame of the \B meson). 
At the \B factories, only the proper-time difference $\Delta t$ between the decays
of the two neutral \B mesons from the \Ups can be determined, but, 
because the two \B mesons evolve coherently (keeping opposite flavours as long as
none of them has decayed), the 
above formulae remain valid 
if $t$ is replaced with $\Delta t$ and the production flavour is replaced by the flavour 
at the time of the decay of the accompanying \B meson in a flavour-specific state.
As can be seen in the above expressions,
the mixing probabilities 
depend on three mixing observables:
$\Delta m$, $\Delta\Gamma$,
and $|q/p|^2$ which signals \CP violation in the mixing if $|q/p|^2 \ne 1$.

In the next sections we review in turn the experimental knowledge
on the \Bd decay-width and mass differences, 
the \Bs decay-width and mass differences,  
\CP violation in \Bd and \Bs mixing, and mixing-induced \CP violation in \Bs decays. 
% these three parameters, separately

Many time-dependent \Bd--\Bdbar oscillation analyses have been performed by the 
ALEPH, \babar, \belle, CDF, \dzero, DELPHI, LHCb, L3 and OPAL collaborations. 
The corresponding measurements of \dmd are summarized in 
\Table{dmd},
%\Tabless{dmd}{dmd2D}, 
where only the most recent results
are listed (\ie\ measurements superseded by more recent ones are omitted)\footnote{
  \label{foot:life_mix:CDFnote8235:2006}
  Two old unpublished CDF2 measurements~\cite{CDFnote8235:2006,CDFnote7920:2005}
  are also omitted from our averages, \Table{dmd} and \Fig{dmd}.}.
Although a variety of different techniques have been used, the 
individual \dmd
results obtained at the LEP and Tevatron energy colliders have remarkably similar precision.
The systematic uncertainties are not negligible; 
they are often dominated by sample composition, mistag probability,
or \b-hadron lifetime contributions.
Their average is compatible with the recent and more precise measurements 
from the asymmetric \B factories and the LHCb experiment.
Before being combined, the measurements are adjusted on the basis of a 
common set of input values, including the averages of the 
\b-hadron fractions and lifetimes given in this report 
(see \Secss{fractions}{lifetimes}).
Some measurements are statistically correlated. 
Systematic correlations arise both from common physics sources 
(fractions, lifetimes, branching ratios of \b hadrons), and from purely 
experimental or algorithmic effects (efficiency, resolution, flavour tagging, 
background description). Combining all published measurements
listed in \Table{dmd}
% ~%\cite{Abdallah:2002mr,CDF_dmd,Buskulic:1996qt,BABAR_dmd,Belle_dmd,Abreu:1997xq,Acciarri:1998pq,OPAL_dmd} 
and accounting for all identified correlations
as described in \Ref{Abbaneo:2000ej_mod,*Abbaneo:2001bv_mod_cont} yields $\dmd = \hfagDMDWfull$.

On the other hand, ARGUS and CLEO have published 
measurements of the time-integrated mixing probability 
\chid~\cite{Albrecht:1992yd,*Albrecht:1993gr_cont,Bartelt:1993cf,Behrens:2000qu}, 
which average to $\chid =\hfagCHIDU$.
Following \Ref{Behrens:2000qu}, 
the width difference \DGd could 
in principle be extracted from the
measured value of $\Gd=1/\tau(\Bd)$ and the above averages for 
\dmd and \chid 
(provided that \DGd has a negligible impact on 
the \dmd $\tau(\Bd)$ analyses that have assumed $\DGd=0$), 
using the relation
\begin{equation}
\chid = \frac{\xd^2+\yd^2}{2(\xd^2+1)} ~~~ \mbox{with} ~~ \xd=\frac{\dmd}{\Gd} 
~~ \mbox{and} ~~ \yd=\frac{\DGd}{2\Gd} \,.
\labe{chid_definition}
\end{equation}
However, direct time-dependent studies provide much stronger constraints: 
%%% DELPHI obtained
%%% $|\DGd|/\Gd < 18\%$ at \CL{95}~\cite{Abdallah:2002mr}, 
%%% while \babar obtained 
%%% % $-8.4\% < -{\rm sign}({\rm Re} \lambda_{\CP}) \DGGd < 6.8\%$ % closer to what \babar quoted
%%% $-6.8\% < {\rm sign}({\rm Re} \lambda_{\CP}) \DGGd < 8.4\%$
%%% at \CL{90}~\cite{Aubert:2003hd,*Aubert:2004xga_mod_cont}, 
$|\DGd|/\Gd < 18\%$ at \CL{95} from DELPHI~\cite{Abdallah:2002mr},
$-6.8\% < {\rm sign}({\rm Re} \lambda_{\CP}) \DGGd < 8.4\%$
at \CL{90} from \babar~\cite{Aubert:2003hd,*Aubert:2004xga_mod_cont},
and ${\rm sign}({\rm Re} \lambda_{\CP})\DGGd = (1.7 \pm 1.8 \pm 1.1)\%$~\cite{Higuchi:2012kx}
from Belle, 
where $\lambda_{\CP} = (q/p)_{\particle{d}} (\bar{A}_{\CP}/A_{\CP})$
is defined for a \CP-even final state 
%%% and where \DGd is defined as\footnote{This sign convention for 
%%% \DGd, taken from \Ref{Aubert:2003hd,*Aubert:2004xga_mod_cont},
%%% is opposite to that used for \DGs in \Secss{taubs}{DGs}.}
%%% $\DGd = \Gamma(\Bd_{\rm H})-\Gamma(\Bd_{\rm L})$
(the sensitivity to the overall sign of 
${\rm sign}({\rm Re} \lambda_{\CP}) \DGGd$ comes
from the use of \Bd decays to \CP final states).
In addition, the \dzero collaboration have recently extracted a value of 
$\DGGd=(0.50 \pm 1.38)\%$\cite{Abazov:2013uma,*Abazov:2011yk_mod,*Abazov:2010hv_mod_cont,*Abazov:2010hj_mod_cont,*Abazov:2011yk_cont}
from their measurements of the same-sign dimuon charge asymmetry, 
under the interpretation that 
the observed asymmetries are due to \CP violation in neutral $B$-meson mixing and interference.
More recently LHCb has obtained $\DGGd=(-0.044 \pm 0.025 \pm 0.011)\%$~\cite{Aaij:2014owa}
by comparing measurements of the $\Bd \to \jpsi K^{*0}$ and $\Bd \to \jpsi K^0_{\rm S}$
decays, following the method of Ref.~\cite{Gershon:2010wx}.
Assuming ${\rm Re} \lambda_{\CP} > 0$, as expected from the global fits
of the Unitarity Triangle within the Standard Model~\cite{Charles:2011va_mod,*Bona:2006ah},
a combination of these five results (after adjusting the DELPHI and \babar ones to  
$1/\Gd=\tau(\Bd)=\hfagTAUBD$) yields
\begin{equation}
%%% {\rm sign}({\rm Re} \lambda_{\CP}) 
\DGGd  = \hfagSDGDGD \,.
\end{equation}
%%% The sign of ${\rm Re} \lambda_{\CP}$ is not measured,
%%% but expected to be positive from the global fits
%%% of the Unitarity Triangle within the Standard Model~\cite{Charles:2011va_mod,*Bona:2006ah}.

Assuming $\DGd=0$ 
% and no \CP violation in mixing, and using the measured \Bd lifetime,
and using $1/\Gd=\tau(\Bd)=\hfagTAUBD$,
the \dmd and \chid results are combined through \Eq{chid_definition} 
to yield the 
world average
\begin{equation} 
\dmd = \hfagDMDWU \,,
\labe{dmd}
\end{equation} 
or, equivalently,
\begin{equation} 
\xd= \hfagXDWU ~~~ \mbox{and} ~~~ \chid=\hfagCHIDWU \,.  
\labe{chid}
\end{equation}
\Figure{dmd} compares the \dmd values obtained by the different experiments.

ones for DELPHI, CDF, \babar, \belle and LHCb have been computed from the individual results 
listed in \Table{dmd} without performing any adjustments. The time-integrated measurements 
of \chid from the symmetric \B factory experiments ARGUS and CLEO have been converted

The \Bd mixing averages given in \Eqss{dmd}{chid}
and the \b-hadron fractions of \Table{fractions} have been obtained in a fully 
consistent way, taking into account the fact that the fractions are computed using 
the \chid value of \Eq{chid} and that many individual measurements of \dmd
at high energy depend on the assumed values for the \b-hadron fractions.
Furthermore, this set of averages is consistent with the lifetime averages 
of \Sec{lifetimes}.

\begin{table}
\caption{Simultaneous measurements of \dmd and $\tau(\Bd)$, and their average.
The \belle analysis also 
measures $\tau(\Bu)$ at the same time, but it is converted here into a two-dimensional measurement 
of \dmd and $\tau(\Bd)$, for an assumed value of $\tau(\Bu)$. 
The first quoted error on the measurements is statistical
and the second one systematic; in the case of adjusted measurements, the 
latter includes a contribution obtained from the variation of $\tau(\Bu)$ or 
$\tau(\Bu)/\tau(\Bd)$ in the indicated range. Units are\invps\ for \dmd

The strength of \Bs mixing is known to be large since more than 20 years. 
Indeed the time-integrated measurements of \chibar (see \Sec{chibar}),
when compared to our knowledge
of \chid and the \b-hadron fractions, indicated that 
\chis should be close to its maximal possible value of $1/2$.
Many searches of the time dependence of this mixing 
were performed by ALEPH~\cite{Heister:2002gk},
CDF (Run~I)~\cite{Abe:1998qj},
DELPHI~\cite{Abreu:2000sh,Abreu:2000ev,Abdallah:2002mr,Abdallah:2003we},
OPAL~\cite{Abbiendi:1999gm,Abbiendi:2000bh} and
SLD~\cite{Abe:2002ua,Abe:2002wfa,Abe:2000gp},
%(we omit references to searches that have been superseded
%by more recent ones).
but did not have enough statistical power
and proper time resolution to resolve 
the small period of the \Bs\ oscillations.

\Bs oscillations have been observed for the first time in 2006
by the CDF collaboration~\cite{Abulencia:2006ze,*Abulencia:2006mq_mod_cont},
based on samples of flavour-tagged hadronic and semileptonic \Bs decays
(in flavour-specific final states), partially or fully reconstructed in 
$1\invfb$ of data collected during Tevatron's Run~II. 
% From the proper-time dependence of these \Bs candidates, CDF
% observe \Bs oscillations with a significance of at least $5\,\sigma$ 
% and measure $\dms = 17.77 \pm 0.10 \pm 0.07\invps$~\cite{Abulencia:2006ze,*Abulencia:2006mq_mod_cont}.
This was shortly followed by an independent evidence obtained by the \dzero collaboration
with $2.4\invfb$ of
data~\cite{D0note5618:2008,*D0note5474:2007,*D0note5254:2006,*Abazov:2006dm_mod_cont}.
More recently the LHCb collaboration obtained the most precise results using fully reconstructed 
$\Bs \to D_s^-\pi^+$ and $\Bs \to D_s^-\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+$ decays at the 
LHC~\cite{Aaij:2011qx,Aaij:2013mpa}.
LHCb has also observed \Bs oscillations with 
$\Bs\to\jpsi K^+K^-$ decays~\cite{LHCB-PAPER-2014-059,*Aaij:2013oba_supersede2}
and with semileptonic $\Bs \to D_s^-\mu^+ X$ decays~\cite{Aaij:2013gja}.
The measurements of \dms are summarized in \Table{dms}.

Multiplying this result with the

Evidence for \CP violation in \Bd mixing
%, which is predicted to be very small in the Standard Model,
has been searched for,
both with flavour-specific and inclusive \Bd decays, 
in samples where the initial 
flavour state is tagged. In the case of semileptonic 
(or other flavour-specific) decays, 
where the final state tag is 
also available, the following asymmetry
\begin{equation} 
\ASLd = \frac{
N(\hbox{\Bdbar}(t) \to \ell^+      \nu_{\ell} X) -
N(\hbox{\Bd}(t)    \to \ell^- \bar{\nu}_{\ell} X) }{
N(\hbox{\Bdbar}(t) \to \ell^+      \nu_{\ell} X) +
N(\hbox{\Bd}(t)    \to \ell^- \bar{\nu}_{\ell} X) } 
= \frac{|p/q|_{\particle{d}}^2 - |q/p|_{\particle{d}}^2}%
{|p/q|_{\particle{d}}^2 + |q/p|_{\particle{d}}^2}
% \simeq 1 - |q/p|^2_{\particle{d}} 
\labe{ASL}
\end{equation} 
has been measured, either in time-integrated analyses at 
CLEO~\cite{Behrens:2000qu,Jaffe:2001hz,*Jaffe:2001hz_cont},
CDF~\cite{Abe:1996zt}%

and \belle~\cite{Nakano:2005jb}.
In the inclusive case, also investigated and published
% at LEP~\cite{DELPHIconf:1997,Barate:2000uk,Abbiendi:1998av},
at ALEPH~\cite{Barate:2000uk} and OPAL~\cite{Abbiendi:1998av},
no final state tag is used, and the asymmetry~\cite{Beneke:1996hv,*Dunietz:1998av}
\begin{equation} 
\frac{
N(\hbox{\Bd}(t) \to {\rm all}) -
N(\hbox{\Bdbar}(t) \to {\rm all}) }{
N(\hbox{\Bd}(t) \to {\rm all}) +
N(\hbox{\Bdbar}(t) \to {\rm all}) } 
\simeq
\ASLd \left[ \frac{\dmd}{2\Gd} \sin(\dmd \,t) - 
\sin^2\left(\frac{\dmd \,t}{2}\right)\right] 
\labe{ASLincl}
\end{equation} 
must be measured as a function of the proper time to extract information 
on \CP violation.

On the other hand, LHCb has studied the time-dependence of the 
charge asymmetry of $B^0 \to D^{(*)-}\mu^+\nu_{\mu}X$ decays
without tagging the initial state~\cite{Aaij:2014nxa}, 
which would be equal to 
\begin{equation} 
\frac{N(D^{(*)-}\mu^+\nu_{\mu}X)-N(D^{(*)+}\mu^-\bar{\nu}_{\mu}X)}%
{N(D^{(*)-}\mu^+\nu_{\mu}X)+N(D^{(*)+}\mu^-\bar{\nu}_{\mu}X)} =
\ASLd \left[ 1- \cos(\dmd \,t)\right]
\label{eq:untagged_ASL}
\end{equation}
in absence of detection and production asymmetries.

\Table{qoverp} summarized the different measurements: 
in all cases asymmetries compatible with zero have been found,  
with a precision limited by the available statistics.

yields $\ASLd = \hfagASLDB$; adding also the \dzero~\cite{Abazov:2012uia}

semileptonic \Bd decays yields

where the relation between \ASLd and $|q/p|_{\particle{d}}$ is given in \Eq{ASL}.
The latest dimuon \dzero analysis~\cite{Abazov:2013uma,*Abazov:2011yk_mod,*Abazov:2010hv_mod_cont,*Abazov:2010hj_mod_cont,*Abazov:2011yk_cont}
separates the \Bd and \Bs contributions by exploiting the dependence on the muon impact parameter cut; combining the 
\ASLd result quoted by \dzero with the above \Bd average of \Eq{ASLDD} yields
%%% \begin{equation}

All the other \Bd analyses performed at high energy, either at LEP or at the Tevatron,
did not separate the contributions from the \Bd and \Bs mesons.
Under the assumption of no \CP violation in \Bs mixing, a number of 
these analyses~\cite{Abazov:2006qw,Ackerstaff:1997vd,Barate:2000uk,Abbiendi:1998av}
quote a measurement of $\ASLd$ or $|q/p|_{\particle{d}}$ for the \Bd meson. Including also 
these results%
\footnote{
  \label{foot:life_mix:Abe:1996zt}

in the previous average % with the average of \Eq{ASLDW}
leads to 
$\ASLd = \hfagASLDA$ % and $|q/p|_{\particle{d}} = \hfagQPDA$
under the assumption $\ASLs =0$. The latter assumption makes sense within the Standard Model, 
since \ASLs is predicted to be much smaller than \ASLd~\cite{Lenz:2011ti,*Lenz:2006hd}, but may not be suitable
in presence of New Physics.

While the imprecise CDF1 result is compatible with no \CP violation%
\footnote{
  \label{foot:life_mix:CDFnote9015:2007-2}
  A measurement from CDF2, 
$ \ASLb = +0.0080 \pm 0.0090 \mbox{(stat)} \pm 0.0068 \mbox{(syst)}$~\cite{CDFnote9015:2007},
more precise than the \dzero measurement,
is also compatible with no \CP violation,
but since it is unpublished since 2007 
we no longer include it in our averages, nor in \Fig{ASLs}.},
the \dzero result of \Eq{Dzero_ASLDS}, obtained by measuring
the charge asymmetry of like-sign dimuons, differs by 2.8 standard
deviations from the Standard Model expectation of
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\mbox{\hspace{3cm}}
$\ASLb({\mathrm{SM}}) = (-2.3\pm 0.4) \times 10^{-4}$%
~\cite{Abazov:2013uma,*Abazov:2011yk_mod,*Abazov:2010hv_mod_cont,*Abazov:2010hj_mod_cont,*Abazov:2011yk_cont,Lenz:2011ti,*Lenz:2006hd}.

%\end{eqnarray}
With a more sophisticated analysis in bins of the
muon impact parameters, \dzero conclude that the overall deviation of the 
their measurements from the SM is at the level of $3.6\,\sigma$.

%%2012%% the averages

are turned\footnote{

Taking into account the uncertainties on
%%2012%% $f'_{\particle{d}}, f'_{\particle{s}}, Z_{\particle{d}},$ and $Z_{\particle{s}}$,
the \b-hadron fractions and mixing parameters, 
the value derived from the \dzero analysis does not show evidence
of \CP violation in the \Bs system.
In addition, the third and fourth lines of \Fig{ASLs} show direct determination of \ASLs
% and hence $|q/p|_{\particle{s}}$ 
obtained by \dzero~\cite{Abazov:2012zz,*Abazov:2009wg_mod_cont,*Abazov:2007nw_mod_cont}
and LHCb~\cite{Aaij:2013gta}
by measuring the time-integrated charge asymmetry of
untagged $\Bs \to D_s \mu X$ decays.
The four results of \Fig{ASLs} are
combined to yield
%%% \begin{equation}
%%% \ASLs = \hfagASLSWval\hfagASLSWsta\mbox{(stat)}\hfagASLSWsys\mbox{(syst)} = \hfagASLSW
%%% \labe{ASLSW}
%%% \end{equation}
$\ASLs = \hfagASLSWval\hfagASLSWsta\mbox{(stat)}\hfagASLSWsys\mbox{(syst)} = \hfagASLSW$
or, equivalently through \Eq{ASL},
%%% \begin{equation}
%%% |q/p|_{\particle{s}} = \hfagQPSWval\hfagQPSWsta\mbox{(stat)}\hfagQPSWsys\mbox{(syst)} = \hfagQPSW \,.
%%% \labe{QPSW}
%%% \end{equation}
$|q/p|_{\particle{s}} = \hfagQPSWval\hfagQPSWsta\mbox{(stat)}\hfagQPSWsys\mbox{(syst)} = \hfagQPSW$.
The quoted systematic errors include experimental systematics as well as the correlated dependence on external 
parameters. 
%%% These results are compatible with no \CP violation in \Bs mixing.

As mentioned above, the \dzero like-sign dimuon analysis investigates 
the dependence of the charge asymmetry 
as a function of the muon impact parameters. 
%%2012%%, allowing the separation of the 
%%2012%%\Bd and \Bs contributions to the result of \Eq{Dzero_ASLDS}.
Interpreting the observed asymmetries in terms of \CP violation in $B$ meson mixing and interference, 
and using 
the mixing parameters and the world $b$-hadron fractions 
of \Ref{Amhis:2012bh}, the \dzero collaboration
extracts~\cite{Abazov:2013uma,*Abazov:2011yk_mod,*Abazov:2010hv_mod_cont,*Abazov:2010hj_mod_cont,*Abazov:2011yk_cont}
values for \ASLd and \ASLs and their correlation
coefficient\footnote{
  \label{foot:life_mix:Abazov:2013uma}
  They also extract at the same time a value for \DGGd (see \Sec{DGd}).}, 
as shown in the first line of \Table{ASLs_ASLd}.
However, the individual 
contributions to the total quoted errors from this analysis and from the
external inputs are not given, so the adjustment of these results to different
or more recent values of the external inputs cannot (easily) be done. 
Using a two-dimensional fit, these values are combined with the pure
\Bd average of \Eq{ASLDD} and with the results from the 
$\Bs \to D_s \mu X$ analyses~\cite{Abazov:2012zz,*Abazov:2009wg_mod_cont,*Abazov:2007nw_mod_cont,Aaij:2013gta},
assumed to be independent and also shown in \Table{ASLs_ASLd}.

We choose the results of \Eqsss{ASLD}{ASLS}{rhoASLDASLS}
as our final averages\footnote{
  \label{foot:life_mix:epsilon_B}
  Early analyses and (perhaps hence) the PDG use the complex
  parameter $\epsilon_{\B} = (p-q)/(p+q)$; if \CP violation in the mixing in small,
  $\ASLd \cong 4 {\rm Re}(\epsilon_{\B})/(1+|\epsilon_{\B}|^2)$ and the averages of
  \Eqss{ASLDD}{ASLD} % \Eqsss{ASLDD}{ASLDW}{ASLD}
  correspond to ${\rm Re}(\epsilon_{\B})/(1+|\epsilon_{\B}|^2)=\hfagREBDD$ %, $\hfagREBDW$
  and $\hfagREBD$, respectively.},
since they better incorporate the available published data. 

The above averages show no evidence of \CP violation in \Bd and \Bs mixing.
They deviate by $\hfagASLDASLSNSIGMA\,\sigma$ from the very small predictions of the Standard Model, 
${\ASLd}^{\rm SM} = -(4.1\pm 0.6)\times 10^{-4}$ and 
${\ASLs}^{\rm SM} = +(1.9\pm 0.3)\times 10^{-5}$~\cite{Lenz:2011ti,*Lenz:2006hd}.
Given the current size of the experimental uncertainties, there is still 
significant room for
a possible New Physics contribution, especially in the \Bs system. 
In this respect, the deviation of the \dzero dimuon
asymmetry~\cite{Abazov:2013uma,*Abazov:2011yk_mod,*Abazov:2010hv_mod_cont,*Abazov:2010hj_mod_cont,*Abazov:2011yk_cont}
from expectation has generated a lot of excitement, however recent results from D0 and LHCb 
have not yet settled the issue, and more experimental data (especially from LHCb) is awaited eagerly. 

At the more fundamental level, \CP violation in \Bs
mixing\footnote{
  \label{foot:life_mix:CPVinBd}
  Of course, a similar formalism exists for the \Bd system; for 
  simplicity we omit here the subscript $s$ for $\phi_{12}$, $M_{12}$ and $\Gamma_{12}$.}
is caused by the weak phase difference 
% Let us define the \CP-violating weak phase difference
\begin{equation}
\phi_{12} = \arg \left[ -{M_{12}}/{\Gamma_{12}} \right], 
\end{equation}
where $M_{12}$ and $\Gamma_{12}$ are the off-diagonal
elements of the mass and decay matrices of the $\Bs-\Bsbar$ system.
This is related to the observed decay-width difference through the relation
\begin{equation}
\DGs = 2|\Gamma_{12}|\cos\phi_{12}+
{\cal O} \left( \left|\frac{\Gamma_{12}}{M_{12}}\right|^2 \right) \,,
\end{equation}
where quadratic (or higher-order) terms in the small quantity
$|\Gamma_{12}/M_{12}| \sim {\cal O}(m_b^2/m_t^2)$ can be neglected. 
The SM prediction for this phase is tiny~\cite{Lenz:2011ti,*Lenz:2006hd},
\begin{equation}
% \phi_{12}^{\rm SM} = 0.0038\pm0.0010 \,;
\phi_{12}^{\rm SM} = \hfagPHISTWELVESM \,;
\labe{phis12SM}
\end{equation}
however, new physics in \Bs mixing could change this observed phase to
\begin{equation}
\phi_{12} = \phi_{12}^{\rm SM} + \phi_{12}^{\rm NP} \,.
\labe{phi12NP}
\end{equation}
The \Bs semileptonic asymmetry can be expressed as~\cite{Beneke:2003az}
\begin{equation}
\ASLs = 
\Im \left(\frac{\Gamma_{12}}{M_{12}} \right) +
{\cal O} \left( \left|\frac{\Gamma_{12}}{M_{12}}\right|^2 \right) =
\frac{\DGs}{\dms}\tan\phi_{12} +
{\cal O} \left( \left|\frac{\Gamma_{12}}{M_{12}}\right|^2 \right) \,.
\labe{ASLS_tanphi12}
\end{equation}
Using this relation, the current knowledge of \ASLs, \DGs and \dms, 
given in \Eqsss{ASLS}{DGs_DGsGs}{dms} respectively, yield an
experimental determination of $ \phi_{12}$,
\begin{equation}
\tan\phi_{12} = \ASLs \frac{\dms}{\DGs} = \hfagTANPHI \,,
\labe{tanphi12}
\comment{ % start python
from math import *
asls = -0.010460 ; easls = 0.006400
dms = 17.719032  ; edms = 0.042701

tanphi12 = asls*dms/dgs
etanphi12 = tanphi12*sqrt((easls/asls)**2+(edms/dms)**2+(edgs/dgs)**2)
print tanphi12, etanphi12
} % end python
\end{equation}
which only represents a very weak constraint at present.
