\subsection{Exclusive CKM-suppressed decays}
\label{slbdecays_b2uexcl}
% ----------------------------------------------
In this section, we list results on exclusive charmless semileptonic branching fractions
and determinations of $\vub$ based on $\Bb\to\pi\ell\nub$ decays.
The measurements are based on two different event selections: tagged
events, in which case the second $B$ meson in the event is fully
reconstructed in either a hadronic decay (``$B_{reco}$'') or in a 
CKM-favored semileptonic decay (``SL''); and untagged events, in which case the selection infers the momentum
of the undetected neutrino based on measurements of the total 
momentum sum of detected particles and knowledge of the initial state.
We present averages for $\Bb\to\rho\ell\nub$ and $\Bb\to\omega\ell\nub$. Moreover, the average for the  branching fraction $\Bb\to\eta\ell\nub$ is presented for the first time. 

The results for the full and partial branching fraction for $\Bb\to\pi\ell\nub$ are given
in Table~\ref{tab:pilnubf} and shown in Figure~\ref{fig:xlnu} (a).   

When averaging these results, systematic uncertainties due to external
inputs, e.g., form factor shapes and background estimates from the
modeling of $\Bb\to X_c\ell\nub$ and $\Bb\to X_u\ell\nub$ decays, are
treated as fully correlated (in the sense of Eq.~\ref{eq:correlrho}).
Uncertainties due to experimental reconstruction effects are treated
as fully correlated among measurements from a given experiment.  Varying
the assumed dependence of the quoted errors on the measured value
for error sources where the dependence was not obvious had no significant impact.

The determination of \vub\ from $\Bb\to\pi\ell\nub$ decays is
shown in Table~\ref{tab:pilnuvub}, and uses our averages for the partial branching
fractions given in Table~\ref{tab:pilnubf}. Two theoretical approaches are
used: unquenched Lattice QCD and QCD light-cone sum rules.
Lattice calculations of the form factors are limited to small hadron momenta, i.e.
large $q^2$, while calculations based on light-cone sum rules are restricted
to small $q^2$. 

\input{tables/slb/pilnuvub.tex}

An alternative method to determine \vub\ from $\Bb\to\pi\ell\nub$ decays that makes use
of the measurement over the full $q^2$ range is based on a simultaneous fit of the 
BCL (Bourrely, Caprini, Lellouch) form factor parameterization to the data and the LQCD predictions.
The result of the simultaneous fit to the three untagged measurements from \babar and Belle and the 
FNAL/MILC LQCD calculations is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:vub_pilnu_simultaneous}.
A value of $\Vub = (3.23 \pm 0.30) \times 10^{-3}$ is obtained.

The branching fractions for 
$\Bb\to \rho\ell\nub$ decays is computed based on the measurements in
Table~\ref{tab:rholnu} and is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:xlnu} (b). The determination of $\Vub$
from these other channels looks less promising than for
$\Bb\to\pi\ell\nub$ and at the moment it is not extracted.

We also report the branching fraction average for $\Bb\to\omega\ell\nub$, $\Bb\to\eta\ell\nub$ 
and $\Bb\to\eta'\ell\nub$. The measurements for $\Bb\to\omega\ell\nub$ are reported in Table~\ref{tab:omegalnu} 
and shown in Figure~\ref{fig:xulnu1}, while the ones for $\Bb\to\eta\ell\nub$ and  $\Bb\to\eta'\ell\nub$ are reported in Table~\ref{tab:etalnu} and~\ref{tab:etaprimelnu},  and are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:xulnu2}.
