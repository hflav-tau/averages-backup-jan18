%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Our knowledge of the lifetime of each individual weakly decaying \b-hadron species 
has improved by a factor 2--3, with the exception of the
\Xibd (factor 7 improvement), the \Xibu (first measurement), and 
the \b baryons with more than one heavy quark (no measurement yet). 
Impressive precisions of 0.3\% are achieved for the most common species, 
and the hierarchy
$\tau(\Bu)> \tau(B_{s\rm H})> \tau(\Bd) \sim \bar{\tau}(\Bs) > \tau(\Lb) > \tau(B_{s\rm L}) > \tau(\Bc)$
is established. 
Similarly the precision on the decay width differences in the \Bd and \Bs systems has improved by about a factor of two, confirming a sizable value of \DGs in agreement with the Standard Model (SM) prediction.
The results are not yet precise enough to distinguish the small (as expected) value of \DGd from zero.
As to the mass differences, only the uncertainty on \dms has substantially decreased (by a factor 2) 
reaching now the per mil level. Several new results on \CP violation in mixing have been 
published, including the final like-sign dimuon and inclusive muon analyses from \dzero (with a claimed 
$3.6\,\sigma$ overall deviation from the SM), but the averages of the individual \Bd and \Bs asymmetries 
remain well consistent both with zero and with their small SM predictions. 
Very impressive progress has been achieved in the measurement of
\CP violation induced by \Bs mixing in the $b\to c\bar{c}s$ transition, through the 
time-dependent angular analysis of tagged $\Bs\to \jpsi K^+K^-$ and $\Bs\to \jpsi \pi^+\pi^-$ decays,
as well as the time-dependent analysis of tagged  $\Bs\to D_s^+ D_s^-$ decays; 
despite the large improvement in sensitivity, the measured weak phase
$\phiccbars = \hfagPHISCOMB$ remains compatible with zero and with the SM prediction (\hfagPHISSM), 
but its experimental uncertainty (which has reduced by a factor 2.5) is now reaching the level of the SM central value.
Many measurements are still dominated by statistical uncertainties and will improve once new data from the LHC becomes available.

%% %%% cp(t) & ut highlights
The measurement of $\sin 2\beta \equiv \sin 2\phi_1$ from $b \to
c\bar{c}s$ transitions such as $\Bz \to \jpsi\KS$ has reached $<3\,\%$
precision: $\sin 2\beta \equiv \sin 2\phi_1 = 0.682 \pm 0.019$.
Measurements of the same parameter using different quark-level processes
provide a consistency test of the Standard Model and allow insight into
possible new physics.  
% Recent improvements include the use of time-dependent Dalitz plot analyses of $\Bz \to \KS\Kp\Km$ and $\Bz \to \KS\pip\pim$ to obtain \CP\ violation parameters for $\phi\KS$, $f_0(980)\KS$ and $\rho\KS$.  
All results among hadronic $b \to s$ penguin dominated decays of \Bz mesons are currently consistent with the Standard Model expectations.  
Recently, first measurements of \CP violation parameters in $\Bs \to \phi\phi$ have become available, allowing a similar comparison to the value of $\phiccbars$; again, results are consistent with the SM expectation (which in this case is very close to zero).
Among measurements related to the Unitarity Triangle angle $\alpha \equiv \phi_2$, results from the $\rho\rho$ system allow constraints at the level of $\approx
6^\circ$.  
These remain the strongest constraints, although recent results from all of \babar, \belle and LHCb have led to significantly improved precision of the \CP violation parameters in $\Bz \to \pip\pim$ decays.
Knowledge of the third angle $\gamma \equiv \phi_3$ also continues to improve.  
The world average values of the parameters in $B \to DK$ decays now show significant direct \CP\ violation effects, and determinations of $\gamma$ from the individual experiments now approach the level of $10^\circ$ precision.
The precision is expected to improve further as more data and more decays modes, for example time-dependent analysis of $\Bs \to D_s^{\mp}\Kpm$ decays and Dalitz plot analysis of $\Bz \to D\Kp\pim$ decays, are added.

%% %%% semileptonic highlights
Regarding semileptonic $B$-meson decays, only a few new experimental
results have appeared since the last update.
% such as the updated measurement of Cabibbo-suppressed exclusive semileptonic $B$~decays by Belle~\cite{Sibidanov:2013rkk}. 
The changes in the numerical values are mainly due to improvements in the theoretical calculations: the form factor normalization in $B\to D^*\ell\nu$ is now known with 1.5\% precision, %~\cite{Bailey:2014tva}, 
and calculations of inclusive decays $B\to X_c\ell\nu$ have reached NNLO precision. %~\cite{Gambino:2011cq}. 
For both $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$, the discrepancy between determinations from exclusive and inclusive decays is now at the level of about 3$\sigma$ -- a puzzle that must be addressed by the next generation of flavour experiments. 
Finally, the anomalous results obtained in $B\to D^{(*)}\tau\nu$ decays %observed by BaBar~\cite{Lees:2012xj}
await experimental confirmation.

%% %%% rare decays highlights
The most important new measurements of rare $b$ hadron decays are coming from the LHC. 
Precision measurements of $\Bs$ decays are particularly noteworthy. 
CMS and LHCb have both been constantly improving their restrictive
limits for the decays $B^0_{(s)}\to\mumu$. 
They recently published a combined analysis that allowed the first observation of the $\Bs\to\mumu$ decay to be obtained, and provided three standard deviations evidence of the $\Bz\to\mumu$ decay. 
These results are compatible with the SM predictions, and yield constrains on the parameter space of new physics models.
Atlas, CMS and LHCb have also performed angular analyses of the $\Bz\to\Kstarz\mumu$ decay, complementing and extending earlier results from \babar and Belle. 
One of the observables measured by LHCb, $P_5^{\prime}$, differs from the SM prediction by 3.7 standard deviations in one of the $m^2_{\mumu}$ intervals.
Updated measurements from LHCb, and results from other experiments on this observable, are keenly anticipated.
Among the $CP$ violating observables in rare decays, the ``$K\pi$ puzzle'' persists, and important new results have appeared in three-body decays.
LHCb has produced many other results on a wide variety of decays, including $b$ baryon decays. %, as indicated in the tables in Sec.~\ref{sec:rare}.  
Belle and \babar\ continue to produce new results though their output rates are dwindling.  
It will still be some years before we see new results from the upgraded SuperKEKB $B$ factory and the Belle~II experiment.

%% %%% b to charm highlights
Many $b$ to charm results from LHCb are included in our report for the  
first time this year, combining with results from \babar, Belle and CDF to yield a total of 632 measurements reported in 216 papers.
The huge combined sample of $b$ hadrons allows measurements of decays to states with open or hidden charm content with unprecedented precision.
Since our previous report, there is a dramatically increased number of results on decays of the $\Bc$ meson and of $b$ baryons.

%%% charm highlights
In the charm sector, $\Dz$--$\Dzb$ mixing is now well-established.
Measurements of 45 separate observables from five experiments are input 
into a global fit for 10 underlying parameters, and the no-mixing 
hypothesis is excluded at a confidence level exceeding $11.5\sigma$. 
The mixing parameters $x$ and $y$ differ from zero by 
$2.4\sigma$ and $9.4\sigma$, respectively. The central values are 
consistent with mixing arising from long-distance processes, as
predicted by theory; thus it will be difficult to identify 
new physics from mixing alone. The WA value for the observable $y_{\CP}$ 
is positive, which indicates that the \CP-even state is shorter-lived 
as in the $\Kz$--$\Kzb$ system. However, $x$ also appears to be 
positive, which implies that the \CP-even state is heavier, 
unlike in the $\Kz$--$\Kzb$ system.

%Concerning \CP\ violation in the $D^0$-$\dbar$ system,
In the $\Dz$--$\Dzb$ system, 
there is no evidence for \CP violation arising from mixing ($|q/p|\neq 1$) or 
from a phase difference between the mixing amplitude and 
a direct decay amplitude ($\phi\neq 0$). An initial evidence for direct
\CP violation in $D^0\ra K^+K^-$ and $D^0\ra \pi^+\pi^-$ decays is currently unconfirmed. 
Inputting the relevant measurements into a global 
fit gives $\Delta a^{\rm dir}_{CP}\neq 0$ with a significance 
of $2.4\sigma$.

%% tau highlights
The \mtau branching fraction fit has been updated using results from two
\babar papers and one from Belle, and updating the constraints on
the experimental branching fraction measurements.
The precise Belle measurement of the \mtau lifetime reduced the uncertainty on the PDG 2013 average by a factor two. 
We have updated the lepton universality tests, which give significantly improved precision thanks to the smaller uncertainty on the \mtau lifetime.
We have also updated the three determinations of \Vus using the \mtau HFAG averages; there is no significant change with respect to the HFAG 2012 report.
We updated the list of upper limits on \mtau Lepton-Flavour-Violating
decays and, for the first time, we combine the available experimental
information to compute world-average limits.
