\section{Acknowledgments}

We are grateful for the strong support of the 
ATLAS, \babar, \belle, BES, CLEO, CDF, CMS, \dzero\ and LHCb collaborations,
without whom this compilation of results and world averages would not have  
been possible. The success of these experiments in turn would 
not have been possible without the excellent operations of the 
CESR, PEP-II, KEKB, Tevatron, BEPC and LHC accelerators, and fruitful 
collaborations between the accelerator groups and the experiments.
We also recognise the interplay between theoretical and experimental
communities that has provided a stimulus for many of the measurements in this
document.

Our averages and this compilation have benefitted greatly from 
contributions to the Heavy Flavor Averaging Group from numerous
individuals. We especially thank David Kirkby, Yoshihide Sakai, 
Simon Eidelman, Soeren Prell, and Gianluca Cavoto for their
past leadership of HFAG. 
We are grateful to Paolo Gambino and Vera L\"{u}th for assistance with
averages that appear in Chapter~\ref{sec:slbdecays};
to David Asner, David Cassel, Milind Purohit, and 
Patrick Roudeau for significant contributions to 
Chapter~\ref{sec:charm_physics};
and to Michel Davier for providing valuable input to Chapter~\ref{sec:tau}.
We also acknowledge the computing resources and support provided to HFAG by
SLAC.
